 **Project: React App**

**Description:**
This is a simple React application that displays a message on the screen. It uses the latest version of React (18) and is bundled with webpack.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-app
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

This will start a webpack dev server on port 3000. You can view the application by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Project Structure:**

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the entry point of the application. It loads the React application and the stylesheet.
- `index.css`: This is the stylesheet for the application.
- `App.js`: This is the React component that displays the message on the screen.
- `package.json`: This file contains the project's dependencies and scripts.

**Code Explanation:**

The `index.html` file is a simple HTML document that loads the React application and the stylesheet.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>React App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
<script src="./App.js"></script>
</html>
```

The `index.css` file contains the styles for the application.

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

#root {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```

The `App.js` file is the React component that displays the message on the screen.
